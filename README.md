## 1. Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Overview
This application is designed with role-based access control (RBAC), allowing users to have different levels of access depending on their role. Users authenticate via an **email ID** and **password**, and the system grants permissions based on predefined roles. There are multiple roles in the application, such as **Admin**, **Doctor**, **Lab Tech**, **Moderator**, and **Nurse**, each with specific permissions for different sections of the application, including employee management and report creation and viewing.

### Authentication
- **Login Page**: Users log in using their **email ID** and **password**.
- The **Admin** account can use the following credentials to log in:
  - **Email ID**: `Abcd@gmail.com`
  - **Password**: `123`
  
  After logging in as **Admin**, users have access to all functionalities for employee management and report handling.

- Other roles can be evaluated by using the **email IDs** present in the employee section, with the common password `123` for all roles.

## 2. Employee Management

The **Employee Section** allows the **Admin** to manage employees, including adding, editing, deleting, and changing their roles. The **Admin** has full control over this section and can perform the following actions:

- **Create Employee**: Admins can create new employee profiles.
- **Edit Employee**: Admins can modify employee details, including roles.
- **Delete Employee**: Admins can delete employee profiles.
- **Change Role**: Admins can assign or change the roles of employees, such as **Doctor**, **Lab Tech**, **Moderator**, or **Nurse**.

Other roles, such as **Doctor**, **Lab Tech**, **Moderator**, and **Nurse**, do not have access to this section. They cannot create, edit, delete, or modify employee information.

## 3. Report Management

### Report Types

There are two types of reports in the system:

1. **Lab Report**: A report generated by the **Lab Tech**.
2. **Doctor's Report**: A report generated by the **Doctor**.

These reports can be created, edited, viewed, or deleted by different roles based on permissions.

## 5. Conclusion

This project provides a secure and flexible role-based access control system that ensures appropriate permissions for different roles, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. The **Admin** has full control over all aspects of the system, including employee management and report handling. Other roles, such as **Doctor**, **Lab Tech**, **Moderator**, and **Nurse**, have specific permissions designed to meet their responsibilities while preventing unauthorized access to certain features. 

The system is structured to ensure that each role only has access to the actions and data that they are permitted to interact with, providing a clear separation of duties and maintaining operational security.
